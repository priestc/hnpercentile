== Hacker News Karma Tracker

A process crawls all items posted on Hacker News (link submissions, comments, etc) every 10 minutes, collects usernames and karma values and stores them into a database that this site uses. Users who have not made a submission or comment on the site after January 25th 2013 may not be included in this site's database. All data comes from the HNSearch API. See code on Github.
